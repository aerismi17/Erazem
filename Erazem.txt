car breaks down
Your car breaks down along a gravel path in the middle of the woods. Your friend sighs,  banging the dashboard with her fists in front of her.  "Gosh Darn it! What do you want to do?  We're already lost!" She asks after a moment of silence. You stare ahead into the dark road  and spy a trail leading off to the side through dense foliage. "What do you think that is? "  You ask, pointing at your discovery. "A trail. Leading nowhere..." your friend says. With  extreme curiosity, you decide to seek help alongside adventure, while your friend decides to  look for help back the way you came. So, you and your friend decide to split up (obviously  the smartest decision, guys).Do you:  A. suggest you take the trail to see if you can find help nearby?  or  B. ditch the car and continue going down the road by foot?
take the small trail
You hop out of the car, say goodbye to your friend and plan to meet up later at the car if either of  you are successful. Your friend says "You're an idiot, you know that right?" The laugh dies in your  throat as you peer more closely towards the trail. It turns very early on, making the final destination   impossible to see. "Shake it off" you tell yourself and sing some Taylor Swift to lift your spirits  before continuing on your way. Finally, you reach the bend in the road and see a tunnel carved into  the stony earth. Do you:  A. Crawl through the tunnel, leaving some of your things behind (flashlight, trailmix, and phone)  Or:  B. walk past the Tunnel and continue into the shrubbery 
ditch car
"Alright. Well I'll see you when you get help. Hopefully I can find something up there." You take  another hard look up the road. "Good luck." your friend says as she gets out of the car.  You take a moment to think. Your backpack has limited space, however, and you know you need to  bring essentials for the trek uphill.Do you: A. bring a flashlight, water and trail mixor B. bring matches and a knife
take the small trail
crawl through the tunnel
You enter the mouth of the tunnel and slip, falling to the ground and sliding down a ways along  what seems to be a slide carved into the rock (much like the pipes leading to the chamber of  secrets) before you land in a pile of hardened cherry pits. You see steps cut into the tunnel and  lined with wooden planks leading down into darkness. Do You:    A. take the cherry pits although it would mean leaving your knife behind  Or:  B. continue along the trail
walk past the tunnel
You continue meandering down the trail until you reach a gigantic fallen tree blocking your  path. The roots spread out in front of you like a spider web and the hollow inside leads into the  trees musky interior. You think you catch something move inside, but it may have just been a trick  of the light. Further up, you glimpse a dense canopy of oak trees climbing into the sky. &=Do you: A. Duck your head and enter the hollowed tree?Or:B. Climb the roots up to the tree's upward facing side?
crawl through the tunnel
take the cherry pits$
You pick up a handful of the cherry pits and some of them crumble to dust in your hand. Behind the  cherry pits you can see what looks to be an old fashioned stepstool folded under the cherry pits and  fallen earth. Then you die. END OF GAME. 
continue along the trail*
You walk on, soon reaching the wooden steps and begin to descend. But when you reach the  second step you fall through a shoot and land on an unknown sticky substance. The smell is  unbearable and the darkness engulfs you. Do you:  A. light one of your 5 matches Or:  B. Light all of them at once Or:  C. feel around the shoot walls for a way out.
continue along the trail*
light one of the matches
You strike the match and recognize the substance around you as a mixture of rotten fruits and  vegetables and rancid meat. You wonder what purpose this area might have served. A larder,  perhaps? The match flickers in your hand and you are reminded of your dire situation. You can see  the opening of the shoot far above you, the only exit. The remains of wooden crates line the walls,  and you can see a sharp hook by the ground near your feet. Do You:   A. move the crates out of the way to look for another exit? Or:   B. Take the hook?
light all of the matches$
You light each of the matches in quick succession, but find you cannot hold all of them at once.  Some of the matches fall to the floor, catching the rotten substance on fire, and now you can tell it  seems to be the remains of food: apples, cherries, and rancid meat. However, this information does  you little good when the fire reaches you and you choke on the smoke and dusty air, dying a  miserable death. END OF GAME.
feel along the edges of the cave
As you drag your fingers along the cave walls, you accidentally disturb what feels like a wooden structure leaning up against the mouth of a cave. It falls to the ground loudly and a you hear a growl  emanating from the empty blackness. A creature scuttles out from the cave on thin narrow legs and  trips over the mushy substance that surrounds the both of you. You press yourself flat against the  ground, sinking a few more inches into the disgusting goo. Although you dare not move lest the  creature becomes aware of your location, you know that the space is small and it will find you  sooner or later. Do you:   A. Disturb the peace and skewer it with your knife Or:  B. Remain in your position and wait for the creature to make the first move
light one of the matches
move the crates out of the way$
You shift the crates over, and see the mouth of a small cave. You are excited until you see the  creature which resides there. It appears to be a large rat with the snout and teeth of an alligator.  The creature grumbles in displeasure then licks its chops. This is the last thing you see before a  blinding pain overwhelms you and you crumple to the ground, joining the mess of spoiled food. END  OF GAME
take the hook
You take the hook and examine it. the base of the hook ends in an iron loop. Do You:  A. Tie the hook to the length of rope in your backpack Or:  B. Put your finger through the loop curiously
take the hook
tie the hook to the rope$
You tie the rope snuggly to the hook. It now resembles a grappling hook and you remember,  suddenly, your skill at rockclimbing. "Geronimo!" you yell, and toss the hook into the air, where it  catches between two stones far above. You ascend the rope quickly and find yourself back in the  original tunnel, on solid rock once again. END OF GAME.
put your finger through the loop$
you die somehow. END OF GAME.
feel along the edges of the cave
disturb the peace
You lunge towards the sound of muffled breathing and pierce flesh. The creature jerks 3 times  before finally coming to a standstill. As you pull the knife out the scent of iron clouds your nostrils  and you fall into a deep sleep.   You awaken with a jolt as you hit hard stone. You must have sank beneath the gooey substance and  into a lower chamber. When you reach upwards you touch what seems to be rotten floorboards,  the rotten substance oozes through the gaps, splattering on the ground at regular intervals. you  explore further and discover a gaping hole from which you must have fell. However you cannot  quite figure out what must have lodged there to stop the flow of further debris. Do you:  A. light a match to explore what's going on? Or:   B. crawl past the area?
remain in your position$
You wait silently until the creature finds you and kills you brutally. A wise choice. END OF GAME
disturb the peace
light a match and explore
You light a sputtering match and hold it up to the floorboards. You can see a massive hairy body  precariously blocking the flow of goo and decide that you had better vacate the premises before  the dam breaks. Do you:  A. crawl onwards? or:  B. attempt to push the creature more securely between the floorboards?
crawl past the area$
You crawl past the area and then die. END OF GAME.
light a match and explore
crawl onwards
You move forwards on your hands and knees until you reach the edge of an underground lake. Your  hands sink into the muddy shore and you pull back quickly. The smell of minerals fills your nose and  you can hear the sound of droplets falling from above. You search around the shore with your  hands, feeling the stern of a rowboat. You crawl into the rowboat and paddle to the other side.  Unfortunately the rock is steep and unwilling to let your boat dock: Do you:  A. abandon ship and swim over? Or:   Or jump to the opposite shore?
push the creature between the floorboards$
It falls through and you drown in goop. END OF GAME.
crawl onwards
abandon ship and swim over$
 you abandon ship and swim over. Done. Good job. You are now on the opposite shore. You stumble  and almost fall back in the water, but manage to steady yourself. Trekking onwards, you  accidentally walk into something suspended in chains from the ceiling. Lighting another match you  can make out an iron suit of armor. It looks roughly hewn and threatening with a halberd at its  waist and dark eye sockets. You  remove the helmet gingerly and the skull inside eats your face. END OF GAME.
jump to the opposite shore$
you stand up in the boat, about to leap, but you are unable to get enough traction as the boat steadily sinks into the abyss and accidentally put your foot through its bottom. You try to swim but the sinking boat will not allow you and you are unable to pull your leg through. As you die you distinctly hear the voice of your canoeing instuctor: "Don't ever stand while in your canoe. You will  either sink or fall out." If only you had listened. END OF GAME.
walk past the tunnel
enter the tree
You crawl into the tree's interior and can smell the rotten wood around you. A few beetles  skitter past you and up the sides of the tunnel. You jolt upright and hit your head, when suddenly,  the exit collapses behind you, blocking out the light on all sides except for a dim glow from the  other side of the tree. Terrified, you feel your way forward an inch at a time, until something sharp  grazes your cheek. Do you: Slowly pull out your flashlight and turn it on to get your bearings? Or: B. Blindly throw trailmix in front of you, in hopes that the hellish creature you imagine will be appeased?
climb the roots$
END OF GAME.
enter the tree
turn on flashlight$
 The creature appears momentarily blinded, and in that moment you realize it is only a porcupine, a  relatively harmless creature. But now it is angry and bristles its quills, running forward to damage  your beautiful, beautiful face. Sadly, you are unable to continue without the help of your stunning  good looks. END OF GAME.
throw the trailmix
You scatter the trailmix before you, a peace offering to Satan, before you cross yourself with the  other hand. Alarmingly, it works! The hellish creature fades away into the distance, to what you can  only assume is a hidden gateway to hell, and hopefully one that you shall not pass on your way out.  Shining with victory and anxious sweat, you make your way to the end of the tree tunnel and  collapse into the fresh green grass. Finally, the chirping birds raise you from your lugubrious state  and you stand, surveying the scene. Before you lies a graveyard carpeted in moss. Pulling together  what remains of your shattered nerves, you explore the area more closely. Most of the gravestones  are unmarked except for a large stone slab covered over with moss. The name reads "Erazem  Lueger" in old-fashioned script and "1372-1397".  He only lived to twenty-five. Scraping away a little  moss with your fingernails, you read further, "his body lies within the castle". Castle? What an  adventure! You run your fingers through your hair and your stomach clenches in sudden  excitement. You continue down the graveyard only to see further unmarked graves and mossy  pebbles lodged in the earth. Finally, you reach a pathway leading through the woods, which looks as  if it was cut into the foliage by some sort of wild animal. You can see tufts of fur caught in a thorny  bush and broad footprints leading into the brush. To your other side you can see a tree with strong  branches within your reach.Do you:   A. go down the animal path? Or: B. Climb the tree?
throw the trailmix
go down the animal path*
You creep slowly through the foliage but accidentally catch the edge of your shirt on a branch. The  fabric tears off and joins the animal's fur in swaying to the eerie wind. You wonder whose footprints  you are idiotically following. Could it be a bear? A wild boar? Bigfoot? Finally, you make your way  into a clearing and see a peculiar sight. Two giant deer are locked in mortal combat. Antlers hooked  together, careening into trees and rolling across the forest floor. Or are they mooses? They look  larger than deer. Hmmm is it mooses or meese? You shake your head perplexedly. Perhaps it is  simply moose..? Two moose? You have finally decided on Moosi when one of the moosi kicks its  back leg into your chest and you fall backwards in pain. Rising to your feet again, you are unsure of  what to do.Do you:  A. fight the rampant moosi (they need to be taught a lesson) ? Or:  B.Leap atop one of the moosi's back (You want to be in on the action!)? Or:  C. try to get past the moosi and continue into the dense undergrowth?
climb the tree$
A branch falls on your head and you die. END OF GAME.
go down the animal path*
fight the rampant moosi$
You charge the moosi with terrifying vengeance and they turn around abruptly in surprise. At first you think you have a chance, but then the surprise turns to anger and an antler goes through your forehead.END OF GAME.
leap atop back$
You bend your knees and spring into the air, but just as you are about to land safely, the moose turns its head and you find yourself skewered in a tangle of antlers. END OF GAME.
try to get past the moosi
You slip underneath the hind legs of a moose as it bucks, and slide onto the wet grass: ruining your pants, but free of the danger. You turn to look back, and see one of the moosi collapsed on the ground, an antler skewering it. A close call. You turn back to the forest, and see a dirty stone wall snaked with ivy. As you walk closer, you can see a square outline cut into the stone. It appears to be a door! You ram your shoulder into the door and it gives way with a slow creak. You turn your flashlight on before entering cautiously. The light is unable to reach the farthest edges of the expansive room, but you can smell the pungent scent of rotting debris emanating from all corners. You step backwards in disgust and fall against a stack of ancient pots and pans. The clanging is enough to wake the stone castle, you think to yourself, before you fall to the floor. When you rise, you see a crumpled book by your hand and pick it up gingerly. Do you:  A. read the book Or  B. light it on fire with one of your matches and hurl before you to vanquish the hellish place in flame 
try to get past the moosi
read the book$
You read the book and it burns your eyes with magic powers and spells. END OF GAME.
light it on fire$
You burn the book. TOO bad it was rlly important. END OF GAME.
ditch car
bring a flashlight, water, and trail mix
In the distance, you see a light. You start walking faster, cursing yourself for not wearing better walking shoes. The trek was a strenuous uphill, nearing a cliff. After 10 minutes of brisk walking, you realize no such possible civilization could be up here.The light is gone, and you convince yourself it was an allusion. You decide to contact your friend. Your phone in your pocket has a bar of service, however you notice your cellphone is at 4 percent. You quickly dial your friend’s number, regardless of the amount of noise you make alone in the woods.She picks up in the first two rings. “Did you find something?” She asks.“I can’t find anything. I might come back,” You say, glancing ahead. The trail seems darker than before. “Okay. I think I might be able to meet you at this point on the map-” she says before your cellphone dies. You sigh, frustrated. You put your phone in your back pocket, hoping for a miracle that it might somehow reverse the laws of technology and recharge itself. At this point, you are extremely tired of walking. You have been walking for a long time now, and you’re not sure if you want to continue. Do you: A. jump off the cliffor B. rest near the bush towards the side of the trail
bring matches and a knife
You feel a new surge of confidence as you take the knife in your palm. Clutching it tightly, you start jogging in spite of your newfound joy. The trek uphill is strenuous. Your ringtone blasts from your phone as you are halfway up. You crouch down next to a bush as you pull out your phone. “Hello?” You answer, panting. “Did you find something?” Your friend asks. “I can’t find anything, but I’m still jogging uphill. It looks like really nothing is up here.” You say. Your phone beeps of low battery. “Okay. I think I might be able to meet you at a point on a map-” your friend says before your cellphone dies.“Oh well.” You think to yourself.You stand up briskly but you realize the hem of your sweater is caught on the bush. It topples forward.“Nature.” You mutter as you bend down to place it back where it was standing. “Why do I even bother?” Before you put the bush back, you realize a gaping hole in the wall. You peer inside, and cold air brushes on your face. “THIS is why I bother.” Strangely, you are suddenly mesmerized by an overwhelming feeling of amazement. It’s almost as if your foot takes the first step inside of the gaping hole, and you are emerged by darkness.  You strike a match in the middle of the cave, and are surprised by it’s weakness to lighten your way. You can barely see your own two feet, and you are growing paranoid. Behind you, a rat scuttles and you try not to scream as you hear a wolf howling in the distance. It seems as if your own thoughts grow louder and your mouth ceases to mutter your own thoughts. The tunnel seems to stretch forever, and you understand that once, this path had been traveled many times by an individual just like yourself.  Slightly crazed, you emerge from the damp atmosphere of the cave into the outside world. You feel a weight lift off of your shoulders and start walking. After a while, you are startled to see a grey wolf blocking the trail.Do you:  A. choose to fight with your knife or B. run back in the cave
bring a flashlight, water, and trail mix
jump off cliff$
Cold air hits your face as you jump. You don't feel the the pain when you reach the ground, you only hear the splatter. You're dead. END OF GAME.
rest near bush towards side of trail
You lay your back on the wall next to the bush. You close your eyes for a slight second, hoping for some peace and silence after a tiring hike. Instead, a damp breeze from your left makes you shiver. You open your eyes and look to your left. It would be impossible for a bush to just- breathe on you. You look closer behind the bush and realize it is a hidden entrance, a cave leading into the mountain. Strangely, you are suddenly mesmerized by an overwhelming feeling of amazement. Your curiosity leads you to stand up and pull the bush aside, completely revealing the entrance to yourself. It’s almost as if your foot takes the first step inside. You reach into your backpack after you are submerged in the darkness of the cave. You click on it’s light to reveal the burgundy walls. You shiver as you start walking faster, scared by the eerie aura of the cave. You emerge from the cave, ten minutes later. You breathe in the air that surrounds you, thankful it isn’t that of a damp cave. You look ahead into the darkness, and the path only reveals that of a tall building. Do you: A. Continue on the path or B.Go back
rest near bush towards side of trail
continue on the path
You pack your flashlight away, not wanting to use any of the battery. The moon glistens above, lighting your path and illuminating the old building. From a short distance, it looks like ancient remains. However, you hold on to the hope that someone may live inside and may have the abilities to help you fix your car. You reach the entrance of the building. The heavy door is propped open by a rock, welcoming you inside. Your feet make your way in and you take in your surroundings. The inside is dimly lit, and a long cloth covering the stone walls catches your eye. You do not recognize the material, yet it seems to take shape of a flag. Perhaps it’s current condition makes it unrecognizable, as the material seems tattered and frayed. You slowly creep inside, your feet taking unsure steps. The door suddenly slams behind you, and you drop your flashlight. Do you: A.run down the hallway or B.run back to the door to try and open it
go back$
You tremble back into the cave, overwhelmed by the feeling of nausea. You decide to become a caveman, and dwell inside the cave for the rest of your life. END OF GAME.
continue on the path
run down the hallway$
You run down the hallway as fast as you can, getting away from the door as fast as possible. You are certainly spooked, and your feet echo across the ground. All of a sudden, the ground gives underneath you, and you fall into darkness. END OF GAME.
run back to the door to try and open it
You run back to the door, pounding on hard slab of stone. "HELLO? Is there anyone out there?" You scream. You wait for a moment, but the other side only seems to reveal silence. You turn your back on the door, sinking down on the ground. In the corner of your eye, you see a white flash dart across the room. Instantly, your hairs rise and you feel the goosebumps on your arm.  Twenty minutes later, you are still in the same position. You seem to be paralyzed by the thought you are stuck in the castle, and decide to eat your trail mix to cheer yourself up. You hoist yourself off the ground, and while nibbling on some chex, you decide to continue your journey down the hallway. You come across a fork in the hallway. Which way do you go?Do you: A.Go right, where the end of the hallway is lit by something or B.Go left, where you can only see darkness
run back to the door to try and open it
go right, where the end of the hallway is lit by something
You walk down the hallway with confidence, sure that the light means that someone lives in the castle. As you get closer, you open your mouth to speak. "Hello?" You do not hear a word once you approach the room. In the center of the room, a floating eery flame blinks out, and you are surrounded by darkness before you can examine the rest of the room.  *CREEPY CHIDLREN’S LAUGHTER* The laughter scares you, and you drop your chex mix in fear. A cold gust of wind whooshes by your feet, and when you reach down to pick up your comfort food, you realize it has eerily disappeared. "How odd." You think to yourself. What do you do now?Do you: A. Feel along the wall for a way outor B.Go back and try the left hallway
go left, where you can only see darkness$
You inch down the hallway, unsure of your next footstep. A rat scuttles beside you, and you hear your own thoughts getting louder. Or are those screams? Anyways, you die of dehydration after walking down the endless hallway- that seems to continue forever. END OF GAME.
go right, where the end of the hallway is lit by something
feel along the wall for a way out$
You begin feeling along the wall when you feel a hard wood case- sort of like book shelf.A book is fallen over, so you straighten it regardless of the dust that encompasses the book. The bookshelf automatically seems to slide over, and the wall seems to reveal a secret entrance to another place of the castle. You take a bold step forward as you think to yourself, "I proceed with unwavering certainty of my decisions." The entrance seems to stretch for a long time, and you are getting sleepier as you walk along the path. Before you know it, you’ve closed your eyes, and are now staggering along the...path? You open your eyes, and it’s morning. "You’re back! I was getting extremely worried. You were seriously passed out when I got here a while ago." Your friend says, sitting on a tree stump with her legs crossed. She takes a bite out of her apple. "You hungry?" She asks, throwing you the apple. You catch it, wondering if this was really happening. "How did you find me?" You ask, taking a quick glance behind the bush as you do. You almost drop the apple as you gasp. The gaping hole is not there anymore, and the hidden entrance is gone. "I got that call from you so I decided to just walk up the way you did. I’m so glad it was one straight road or else I would’ve gotten lost!" She laughs out loud. "Amy, this isn’t funny. I swear I had the weirdest dream…" You begin. YOU WON!! END OF GAME.

bring matches and a knife
choose to fight with your knife
You take your knife out, scared of the wolf. You start walking towards it, and to your surprise, it vanishes into the woods. The moon glistens above, lighting your path and illuminating the old building. From a short distance, it looks like ancient remains. However, you hold on to the hope that someone may live inside and may have the abilities to help you fix your car. You reach the entrance of the building. The heavy door is propped open by a rock, welcoming you inside. Your feet make your way in and you take in your surroundings. The inside is dimly lit, and a long cloth covering the stone walls catches your eye. You do not recognize the material, yet it seems to take shape of a flag. Perhaps it's current condition makes it unrecognizable, as the material seems tattered and frayed. You slowly creep inside, your feet taking unsure steps. The door suddenly slams behind you, and you drop your only weapon. It clatters on the ground, sending an echo throughout the castle. You quickly reach down to pick it up, only to touch a sticky substance you cannot see. Do you: A.scream, possibly waking any ghouls or spirits dwelling in the houseor B.bring the substance to your nose to smell it
run back in the cave$
You instantly swivel around, and the wolf howls. You start running for your life, moving as fast as your legs possibly could run. However, you feel the wolf behind you, its paws surely on the gravel right behind your tail. Before you reach the cave, the wolf seems to soar through the air and knock you off of the cliff. As you fall, you wonder why you hadn't used the knife you had packed. You're dead. END OF GAME.
choose to fight with your knife
scream, possibly waking any ghouls or spirits dwelling in the house
You scream as loud as you possibly can, suddenly scared of the darkness engulfing you. Your only weapon is gone, and you are still shook from the eeriness of the cave earlier. You hear a window shattering in the distance, and you wonder if that was caused by your own screams, or by something else. You realize that the broken window must be your way out. You see the set of steps leading up the stairs and you decide to climb them. At the top, you enter the second floor of the mansion. An eerie hallway stretches in front of you, doors on opposite ends. You wonder if the bedrooms are located here, but fail to find any, as all of the doors are locked except for one. There is another set of steps at the end of the hallway. Do you: A.Climb up the stairsor B. Enter the unlocked room
bring the substance to your nose to smell it$
You smell the sticky substance. It stinks of chemicals, and you do not notice yourself dozing off. It must have been a toxic chemical.END OF GAME.

You climb up the stairs and your foot falls through a crack. It seems to be stuck in the wood, and you are afraid you may not be able to wiggle yourself out. Do you: A. Let go of your pants or B. Sacrifice one shoe?
enter the unlocked room$
It's gotta be unlocked for a reason right? You enter the room when you see a white figure darting in the corner of your vision. You turn around, trying to track where it may have gone. You feel a sudden coldness behind you, and it engulfs you.END OF GAME.

let go of your pants$
You embarrassingly strip yourself of your pants, and you stretch your sweater down to your knees.*Children's laughter* You are spooked by the noises you hear in the distance. You walk faster, the cold touching your legs as you climb higher up the stairs. Unfortunately, something seems to pull your leg from below, and you trip down the stairs. END OF GAME.
sacrifice one shoe
You hear a clunk as your shoe clutters below. You tug on the material of your pants, hoping it would come loose. Unfortunately, it doesn't, and you see a white flash at the top of the stairs. "Is there someone there?" You tremor. A cold shiver runs up your spine, and you struggle to free your leg. You light a match, hoping to scare whatever animal was at the top of the stairs. You then burn the hem of your jeans, freeing yourself, and consequently burning yourself in the process. You drop the match into the hole, and you see a fire light at the bottom. "Crap" You think to yourself, and like any dumb person in a horror movie, you run upstairs, because that's where you're going to be free from the impacts of a fire. You run up stairs, choking on smoke as you do. You realize that it probably wasn't the best decision to run upstairs when there was a fire, but no worries! You realize that the extra weight in your bag was that of a gas mask. You slip the gas mask on your face, and prevent yourself from dying of smoke exposure. At the top of the stairs, the heat is extremely overwhelming. As you walk by a door, you feel a cool breeze emanating from the bottom. You look to your right to see a ghastly light from the bottom of the door. Do you: A.) Enter the room or B.)Continue down the hallway
sacrifice one shoe
enter room$
You realize that this is a bathroom. You also realize of the duties you have to take care of. You sit on the toilet, thinking of ways to get out of this horrid mansion. Suddenly, you hear laughter, and a single cannonball is launched from the bottom of the toilet. You are killed. END OF GAME.

The tunnel seems to stretch forever, and you understand that once, this path had been traveled many times by an individual just like yourself.  Slightly crazed, you emerge from the damp atmosphere of the cave into the outside world. You feel a weight lift off of your shoulders and start walking. After a while, you are startled to see a grey wolf blocking the trail.Do you:  A. choose to fight with your knife or B. run back in the cave
bring a flashlight, water, and trail mix
jump off cliff$
Cold air hits your face as you jump. You don't feel the the pain when you reach the ground, you only hear the splatter. You're dead. END OF GAME.
rest near bush towards side of trail
You lay your back on the wall next to the bush. You close your eyes for a slight second, hoping for some peace and silence after a tiring hike. Instead, a damp breeze from your left makes you shiver. You open your eyes and look to your left. It would be impossible for a bush to just- breathe on you. You look closer behind the bush and realize it is a hidden entrance, a cave leading into the mountain. Strangely, you are suddenly mesmerized by an overwhelming feeling of amazement. Your curiosity leads you to stand up and pull the bush aside, completely revealing the entrance to yourself. It’s almost as if your foot takes the first step inside. You reach into your backpack after you are submerged in the darkness of the cave. You click on it’s light to reveal the burgundy walls. You shiver as you start walking faster, scared by the eerie aura of the cave. You emerge from the cave, ten minutes later. You breathe in the air that surrounds you, thankful it isn’t that of a damp cave. You look ahead into the darkness, and the path only reveals that of a tall building. Do you: A. Continue on the path or B.Go back
rest near bush towards side of trail
continue on the path
You pack your flashlight away, not wanting to use any of the battery. The moon glistens above, lighting your path and illuminating the old building. From a short distance, it looks like ancient remains. However, you hold on to the hope that someone may live inside and may have the abilities to help you fix your car. You reach the entrance of the building. The heavy door is propped open by a rock, welcoming you inside. Your feet make your way in and you take in your surroundings. The inside is dimly lit, and a long cloth covering the stone walls catches your eye. You do not recognize the material, yet it seems to take shape of a flag. Perhaps it’s current condition makes it unrecognizable, as the material seems tattered and frayed. You slowly creep inside, your feet taking unsure steps. The door suddenly slams behind you, and you drop your flashlight. Do you: A.run down the hallway or B.run back to the door to try and open it
go back$
You tremble back into the cave, overwhelmed by the feeling of nausea. You decide to become a caveman, and dwell inside the cave for the rest of your life. END OF GAME.
continue on the path
run down the hallway$
You run down the hallway as fast as you can, getting away from the door as fast as possible. You are certainly spooked, and your feet echo across the ground. All of a sudden, the ground gives underneath you, and you fall into darkness. END OF GAME.
run back to the door to try and open it
You run back to the door, pounding on hard slab of stone. "HELLO? Is there anyone out there?" You scream. You wait for a moment, but the other side only seems to reveal silence. You turn your back on the door, sinking down on the ground. In the corner of your eye, you see a white flash dart across the room. Instantly, your hairs rise and you feel the goosebumps on your arm.  Twenty minutes later, you are still in the same position. You seem to be paralyzed by the thought you are stuck in the castle, and decide to eat your trail mix to cheer yourself up. You hoist yourself off the ground, and while nibbling on some chex, you decide to continue your journey down the hallway. You come across a fork in the hallway. Which way do you go?Do you: A.Go right, where the end of the hallway is lit by something or B.Go left, where you can only see darkness
run back to the door to try and open it
go right, where the end of the hallway is lit by something
You walk down the hallway with confidence, sure that the light means that someone lives in the castle. As you get closer, you open your mouth to speak. "Hello?" You do not hear a word once you approach the room. In the center of the room, a floating eery flame blinks out, and you are surrounded by darkness before you can examine the rest of the room.  *CREEPY CHIDLREN’S LAUGHTER* The laughter scares you, and you drop your chex mix in fear. A cold gust of wind whooshes by your feet, and when you reach down to pick up your comfort food, you realize it has eerily disappeared. "How odd." You think to yourself. What do you do now?Do you: A. Feel along the wall for a way outor B.Go back and try the left hallway
go left, where you can only see darkness$
You inch down the hallway, unsure of your next footstep. A rat scuttles beside you, and you hear your own thoughts getting louder. Or are those screams? Anyways, you die of dehydration after walking down the endless hallway- that seems to continue forever. END OF GAME.
go right, where the end of the hallway is lit by something(A)
feel along the wall for a way out$
You begin feeling along the wall when you feel a hard wood case- sort of like book shelf.A book is fallen over, so you straighten it regardless of the dust that encompasses the book. The bookshelf automatically seems to slide over, and the wall seems to reveal a secret entrance to another place of the castle. You take a bold step forward as you think to yourself, "I proceed with unwavering certainty of my decisions." The entrance seems to stretch for a long time, and you are getting sleepier as you walk along the path. Before you know it, you’ve closed your eyes, and are now staggering along the...path? You open your eyes, and it’s morning. "You’re back! I was getting extremely worried. You were seriously passed out when I got here a while ago." Your friend says, sitting on a tree stump with her legs crossed. She takes a bite out of her apple. "You hungry?" She asks, throwing you the apple. You catch it, wondering if this was really happening. "How did you find me?" You ask, taking a quick glance behind the bush as you do. You almost drop the apple as you gasp. The gaping hole is not there anymore, and the hidden entrance is gone. "I got that call from you so I decided to just walk up the way you did. I’m so glad it was one straight road or else I would’ve gotten lost!" She laughs out loud. "Amy, this isn’t funny. I swear I had the weirdest dream…" You begin. YOU WON!! END OF GAME.

bring matches and a knife
choose to fight with your knife
You take your knife out, scared of the wolf. You start walking towards it, and to your surprise, it vanishes into the woods. The moon glistens above, lighting your path and illuminating the old building. From a short distance, it looks like ancient remains. However, you hold on to the hope that someone may live inside and may have the abilities to help you fix your car. You reach the entrance of the building. The heavy door is propped open by a rock, welcoming you inside. Your feet make your way in and you take in your surroundings. The inside is dimly lit, and a long cloth covering the stone walls catches your eye. You do not recognize the material, yet it seems to take shape of a flag. Perhaps it's current condition makes it unrecognizable, as the material seems tattered and frayed. You slowly creep inside, your feet taking unsure steps. The door suddenly slams behind you, and you drop your only weapon. It clatters on the ground, sending an echo throughout the castle. You quickly reach down to pick it up, only to touch a sticky substance you cannot see. Do you: A.scream, possibly waking any ghouls or spirits dwelling in the houseor B.bring the substance to your nose to smell it
run back in the cave$
You instantly swivel around, and the wolf howls. You start running for your life, moving as fast as your legs possibly could run. However, you feel the wolf behind you, its paws surely on the gravel right behind your tail. Before you reach the cave, the wolf seems to soar through the air and knock you off of the cliff. As you fall, you wonder why you hadn't used the knife you had packed. You're dead. END OF GAME.
choose to fight with your knife
scream, possibly waking any ghouls or spirits dwelling in the house
You scream as loud as you possibly can, suddenly scared of the darkness engulfing you. Your only weapon is gone, and you are still shook from the eeriness of the cave earlier. You hear a window shattering in the distance, and you wonder if that was caused by your own screams, or by something else. You realize that the broken window must be your way out. You see the set of steps leading up the stairs and you decide to climb them. At the top, you enter the second floor of the mansion. An eerie hallway stretches in front of you, doors on opposite ends. You wonder if the bedrooms are located here, but fail to find any, as all of the doors are locked except for one. There is another set of steps at the end of the hallway. Do you: A.Climb up the stairsor B. Enter the unlocked room
bring the substance to your nose to smell it$
You smell the sticky substance. It stinks of chemicals, and you do not notice yourself dozing off. It must have been a toxic chemical.END OF GAME.
scream, possibly waking any ghouls or spirits dwelling in the house
climb up the stairs
You climb up the stairs and your foot falls through a crack. It seems to be stuck in the wood, and you are afraid you may not be able to wiggle yourself out. Do you: A. Let go of your pants or B. Sacrifice one shoe?
enter the unlocked room$
It's gotta be unlocked for a reason right? You enter the room when you see a white figure darting in the corner of your vision. You turn around, trying to track where it may have gone. You feel a sudden coldness behind you, and it engulfs you.END OF GAME.
climb up the stairs
let go of your pants$
You embarrassingly strip yourself of your pants, and you stretch your sweater down to your knees.*Children's laughter* You are spooked by the noises you hear in the distance. You walk faster, the cold touching your legs as you climb higher up the stairs. Unfortunately, something seems to pull your leg from below, and you trip down the stairs. END OF GAME.
sacrifice one shoe
You hear a clunk as your shoe clutters below. You tug on the material of your pants, hoping it would come loose. Unfortunately, it doesn't, and you see a white flash at the top of the stairs. "Is there someone there?" You tremor. A cold shiver runs up your spine, and you struggle to free your leg. You light a match, hoping to scare whatever animal was at the top of the stairs. You then burn the hem of your jeans, freeing yourself, and consequently burning yourself in the process. You drop the match into the hole, and you see a fire light at the bottom. "Crap" You think to yourself, and like any dumb person in a horror movie, you run upstairs, because that's where you're going to be free from the impacts of a fire. You run up stairs, choking on smoke as you do. You realize that it probably wasn't the best decision to run upstairs when there was a fire, but no worries! You realize that the extra weight in your bag was that of a gas mask. You slip the gas mask on your face, and prevent yourself from dying of smoke exposure. At the top of the stairs, the heat is extremely overwhelming. As you walk by a door, you feel a cool breeze emanating from the bottom. You look to your right to see a ghastly light from the bottom of the door. Do you: A.) Enter the room or B.)Continue down the hallway
sacrifice one shoe
enter room$
You realize that this is a bathroom. You also realize of the duties you have to take care of. You sit on the toilet, thinking of ways to get out of this horrid mansion. Suddenly, you hear laughter, and a single cannonball is launched from the bottom of the toilet. You are killed. END OF GAME.
continue down the hallway$
The heat kills you. END OF GAME.
